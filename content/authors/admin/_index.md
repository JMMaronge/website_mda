## Hi, I'm Jake!

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at MD Anderson Cancer Center. I work with [Ying Yuan](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/ying_yuan.html) and [Peter Thall](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/peter_thall.html) on Bayesian clinical trial design for cancer studies, particularly those studying the effects of biomarker-targeted therapies.

I earned my PhD in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked with [Paul Rathouz](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/directory/paul-rathouz) and [Jon Schildcrout](https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/Main/JonathanSchildcrout) on robust methods for epidemiological studies with outcome-dependent sampling. This work focused on developing methods for practitioners to use in retrospective studies which resemble commonly-used approaches, but simultaneously yield valid results across many applications. In addition to my dissertation work, I also developed a method for detecting nonlinear personalized treatment rules with [Guanhua Chen](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/chen-guanhua/) and [Jared Huling](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/jared-huling). During this time, I also had the opportunity to be a fellow of the [Morse Society](https://www.waisman.wisc.edu/administrative-core/morse-society/).  

Before beginning my PhD, I spent a summer at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health working with [Ciprian Crainiceanu](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1442/ciprian-m-crainiceanu) on stroke lesion segmentation using structural MRI of the brain. Prior to that, I earned my MS in Biostatistics from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center.
