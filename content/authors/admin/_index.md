## Hi, I'm Jake!

I am a Statistics Leader in the Statistics and Data Science Innovation Hub in Oncology and Vaccines at [GSK](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/). I split my time researching and consulting on (bio)statistical methodology for innovative clinical trial design. My research interests include clinical trial design, observational study design, Bayesian methods, generalized linear models, machine learning, and oncology.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at MD Anderson Cancer Center. I worked with [Ying Yuan](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/ying_yuan.html) and [Peter Thall](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/peter_thall.html) on novel Bayesian clinical trial design for personalized medicine in early-phase oncology trials.

I earned my PhD in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked with [Paul Rathouz](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/directory/paul-rathouz) and [Jon Schildcrout](https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/Main/JonathanSchildcrout) on robust methods for epidemiological studies with outcome-dependent sampling. This work focused on developing methods for practitioners to use in retrospective studies which resemble commonly-used approaches, but simultaneously yield valid results across many applications. In addition to my dissertation work, I also developed a method for detecting nonlinear personalized treatment rules with [Guanhua Chen](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/chen-guanhua/) and [Jared Huling](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/jared-huling). During this time, I also had the opportunity to be a fellow of the [Morse Society](https://www.waisman.wisc.edu/administrative-core/morse-society/).  

Before beginning my PhD, I spent a summer at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health working with [Ciprian Crainiceanu](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1442/ciprian-m-crainiceanu) on stroke lesion segmentation using structural MRI of the brain. Prior to that, I earned my MS in Biostatistics from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center.
